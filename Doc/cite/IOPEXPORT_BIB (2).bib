abstract = {Disaster mitigation is very important in order to reduce the number of victims of both life and material. Alertness in disaster mitigation is urgently needed in every area in all countries of the world, especially in Indonesia. Embedded device technology specifically designed and programmed to detect disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and landslides, storms and hurricanes. The sensors are used according to the type of disaster will be detected. The system will be built this serves as an early warning system that will provide early warning against floods and landslides were predicted would happen. The system can detect floods and landslides in accordance with a sensor mounted on a disaster-prone locations. Device technology development mitigation sensors embedded as floods and landslides integrate hardware and software and Internet networks. Hardware in the form of microchip controllers and software applications of information and communication technology based internet of things. Microcontroller programmed so that it can control the data with computational algorithms can predict natural disasters will occur. With the development of technology these devices could be detected early disaster. For Embedded system could be produced more cheaply with a local content of 60%. This support government programs in the field of technological independence.
